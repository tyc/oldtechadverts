## OTA_trigger.js
This javascript is to open a new window with the URL pointed to a Google Form for collectng the data.

The window is launched in a landscape mode on the left hand side of the screen. So ideally, the page showing the advert should be open on the right hand side. This will allow you have both the form and the advert page side by side.


## oldtechadverts.js
This is javascript that prefills the google form with the URL of the page that OTA_trigger.js is executed from.
The URL is passed into oldtechadverts.js via a parameter in the URL when the window is launched.

the oldtechadverts.js modifies the html to update values of the form.
